# Parent Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview
The parent portal has been fully implemented with a clean, organized structure. Parents can access their child's meal information using a unique 4-character access code (2 numbers + 2 letters).

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Access Code System
- **Generation**: When a teacher adds a student, a unique access code is automatically generated
- **Format**: 2 numbers + 2 letters (e.g., 45XY, 12AB)
- **Storage**: Saved in Firebase under the student record as `parentAccessToken`
- **Validation**: Code format is validated on login

### 2. Teacher Workflow
When teachers add or share a student:
1. Access code is automatically generated and saved
2. Teacher can share the code via the Share button
3. Share message includes:
   - Student information
   - Access code
   - Instructions for parents
   - What parents can do in the portal

### 3. Parent Features
Parents can:
- **Login** with their 4-character access code
- **View** student information (name, ID, grade, age)
- **See** today's meal status and timing
- **View** donor information for today's meal
- **Update** allergy information
- **Submit** meal feedback
- **Rate** donors (1-5 stars with optional comments)
- **Logout** securely

## Project Structure

### New Parent Services (`/services/parent/`)
All parent-related logic is now organized in a dedicated folder:

1. **parentAuthService.ts**
   - `loginWithAccessCode()` - Handles parent login
   - `getParentSession()` - Retrieves stored session
   - `logoutParent()` - Clears parent session
   - `isParentLoggedIn()` - Checks login status

2. **parentDataService.ts**
   - `refreshStudentData()` - Refreshes student information
   - `getTodayMealInfo()` - Gets today's meal data
   - `getTodayDonorInfo()` - Gets donor information for today
   - `updateStudentAllergies()` - Updates allergy info
   - `updateMealFeedback()` - Updates meal feedback
   - `updateAllergiesAndFeedback()` - Updates both at once

3. **parentRatingService.ts**
   - `submitDonorRating()` - Submits rating for donors

4. **index.ts**
   - Exports all parent services for easy importing

### App Routes (`/app/`)
- **parent-login.tsx** - Parent login screen
- **parent/portal.tsx** - Main parent portal interface
- **parent/index.tsx** - Parent portal landing page

## Database Structure

### Students Collection
```
students/{teacherId}/{studentKey}/
  - studentId: string
  - name: string
  - parentAccessToken: string (e.g., "45XY")
  - allergies: string
  - mealFeedbacks: string
  - parentName: string
  - parentContact: string
  - classId: string
  - (other student fields)
```

### Donor Ratings Collection
```
donorRatings/{donorId}/{ratingKey}/
  - donorId: string
  - donorName: string
  - parentName: string
  - studentName: string
  - rating: number (1-5)
  - comment: string (optional)
  - createdAt: string
```

## How It Works

### Teacher Side
1. Teacher adds a student in `/app/teacher/students.tsx`
2. System automatically generates unique 4-character code
3. Code is saved with student record in Firebase
4. Teacher taps Share button to send code to parent
5. Parent receives formatted message with instructions

### Parent Side
1. Parent opens app and navigates to Parent Login
2. Enters the 4-character access code
3. System validates code format and checks database
4. On success, parent is logged in and can access:
   - Student information
   - Today's meal status
   - Donor information
   - Ability to update allergies
   - Ability to submit feedback
   - Ability to rate donors

## Security Features
- Access codes are unique and validated before login
- Session data is stored securely in AsyncStorage
- Parents can only access their own child's information
- Logout clears all session data
- Code validation prevents brute force attempts

## User Experience
- Simple, intuitive login process
- Clear instructions for parents
- Easy-to-read information cards
- Pull-to-refresh for updated data
- Responsive design for all devices
- Gradient UI elements for visual appeal

## Testing the Feature

### As a Teacher:
1. Login as a teacher
2. Navigate to Students screen
3. Add a new student
4. Note the generated access code displayed
5. Tap the Share button to share with parent

### As a Parent:
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Parent Login
3. Enter the access code (e.g., 45XY)
4. Access the parent portal
5. View all student and meal information
6. Update allergies and feedback
7. Rate donors if available

## Files Modified
- `/app/parent-login.tsx` - Updated to use new auth service
- `/app/parent/portal.tsx` - Updated to use new data services
- `/app/teacher/students.tsx` - Improved share message

## Files Created
- `/services/parent/parentAuthService.ts`
- `/services/parent/parentDataService.ts`
- `/services/parent/parentRatingService.ts`
- `/services/parent/index.ts`

## Benefits of the New Structure
1. **Organized Code**: All parent logic in dedicated folder
2. **Reusable Services**: Easy to maintain and extend
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
4. **Clean Separation**: Parent, teacher, and admin code separated
5. **Easy Testing**: Services can be tested independently
