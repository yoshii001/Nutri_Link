# Parent Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview
The parent portal has been completely implemented with a unique access code system that allows parents to view their child's meal information, submit allergies, provide feedback, and rate donors.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Access Code System
- **Format**: 2 numbers + 2 letters (e.g., `45XY`, `12AB`, `78CD`)
- **Generation**: Automatically created when a teacher adds a student
- **Uniqueness**: System ensures no duplicate codes across all students
- **Storage**: Saved in Firebase under `students/{teacherId}/{studentKey}/parentAccessToken`

### 2. Teacher Workflow
When a teacher adds a student:
1. Student profile is created
2. Unique access code is automatically generated
3. Code is saved with the student record
4. Teacher can share the code using the "Share" button
5. Share message includes:
   - Access code
   - Instructions for parents
   - Student information

### 3. Parent Portal Features

#### Login Process
- Parents enter the 4-character access code
- System validates format and uniqueness
- On success, loads student data and redirects to portal

#### Portal Dashboard Shows:
1. **Student Information**
   - Name, ID, grade, age
   - Current access code

2. **Today's Meal**
   - Whether meal was served
   - Time of service
   - Notes from teacher
   - Meal name

3. **Donor Information**
   - Donor name and email
   - Item donated
   - Quantity and description
   - Average rating and total ratings

4. **Parent Actions**
   - Update allergy information
   - Submit meal feedback
   - Rate donors (1-5 stars with optional comment)

### 4. Donor Rating System
- Parents can rate donors on a 5-star scale
- Optional comments allowed
- Ratings stored in Firebase: `donorRatings/{donorId}`
- Donor dashboard displays:
  - Average rating
  - Total number of ratings
  - Recent feedback from parents

## File Structure

### New Files Created
```
/services/firebase/parentService.ts - Parent-specific database operations
/app/parent/README.md - Parent portal documentation
```

### Modified Files
```
/app/parent/portal.tsx - Updated to use new parent service
/app/parent/index.tsx - Redirects to parent login
/app/parent-login.tsx - Updated to use parent service
/app/teacher/students.tsx - Improved share message
```

## Database Structure

### Student Record
```
students/{teacherId}/{studentKey}/
  - studentId: string
  - name: string
  - parentAccessToken: string (unique 4-char code)
  - allergies: string
  - mealFeedbacks: string
  - classId: string
  - ... other fields
```

### Donor Ratings
```
donorRatings/{donorId}/{ratingKey}/
  - donorId: string
  - donorName: string
  - parentName: string
  - studentName: string
  - rating: number (1-5)
  - comment: string (optional)
  - createdAt: string
```

## Services Overview

### parentService.ts
Functions:
- `getStudentByAccessCode()` - Validates code and retrieves student data
- `updateParentSubmittedInfo()` - Updates allergies and feedback
- `getTodayMealForStudent()` - Gets today's meal information
- `getDonorInfoForClass()` - Gets donor info for today's meal

### donorRatingService.ts (existing)
Functions:
- `addDonorRating()` - Saves new rating
- `getRatingsByDonorId()` - Gets all ratings for a donor
- `getDonorAverageRating()` - Calculates average and count

## User Flow

### Teacher Flow
1. Teacher adds student → Access code generated automatically
2. Teacher views student list → See access code displayed
3. Teacher clicks "Share" button → System shares formatted message with code
4. Parent receives access code via share

### Parent Flow
1. Parent opens app → Navigates to "Parent Login"
2. Parent enters 4-character code
3. System validates → Loads student data
4. Parent views portal → See all student and meal info
5. Parent can:
   - Update allergies
   - Submit feedback
   - Rate today's donor

### Donor Flow
1. Donor provides meal to class
2. Parents rate the donor
3. Donor views ratings in dashboard
4. Ratings help donors improve service quality

## Security Considerations

- Access codes are unique per student
- No passwords required (code serves as authentication)
- Parent can only view their own child's information
- Session stored in AsyncStorage for convenience
- Ratings are permanent and cannot be deleted by donors

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Access code generation on student creation
- [x] Access code uniqueness validation
- [x] Parent login with valid code
- [x] Parent login rejects invalid codes
- [x] Portal displays student information
- [x] Portal shows today's meal if available
- [x] Portal shows donor info if available
- [x] Parent can update allergies
- [x] Parent can submit feedback
- [x] Parent can rate donors
- [x] Donor dashboard shows ratings
- [x] Teacher can share access code
- [x] Build completes successfully

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Push notifications when meal is served
2. History of past meals and donations
3. Multiple children support for one parent
4. Email/SMS sharing of access codes
5. Parent profile with saved preferences
6. Meal preferences and restrictions
7. Communication between parent and teacher
8. Photo upload of meals for parent viewing

## Notes

- Access codes are permanent (not time-limited)
- Parents can access portal anytime with valid code
- Teachers can regenerate codes if lost (future feature)
- All data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database
- System supports offline access through caching
