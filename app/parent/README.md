# Parent Portal

This folder contains all parent-facing screens and functionality.

## Overview

The Parent Portal allows parents to access their child's meal information using a unique 4-character access code provided by their child's teacher.

## Access Code System

When a teacher adds a student to the system, a unique access code is automatically generated with the format:
- **2 numbers** (00-99)
- **2 letters** (AA-ZZ)
- Example: `45XY`, `12AB`, `78CD`

This code is:
- Automatically generated and saved in the student profile
- Guaranteed to be unique across all students
- Shared by the teacher through the "Share" button on the student list

## Features Available to Parents

### 1. View Student Information
- Student name, ID, grade, and age

### 2. Today's Meal Information

- Meal name and details

### 3. Donor Information

### 4. Submit Allergies
