# Logout Redirect Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
After successfully signing out, users were not being redirected to the login page. They would remain on the dashboard screen even though they were no longer authenticated.

## Root Cause
The dashboard screens (principal, teacher, and main tabs dashboard) did not check if the user was authenticated. When `signOut()` cleared the auth state, the components didn't have logic to detect this change and redirect to the login page.

The redirection flow worked like this:
1. User logs in → goes to dashboard
2. User clicks logout → auth state is cleared
3. **BUG**: Dashboard component still renders (no auth check)
4. User sees dashboard but can't access any functionality

## Solution
Added authentication guards to all dashboard screens that redirect to login when user is not authenticated.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx** - Main Dashboard
- Added `Redirect` import from 'expo-router'
- Added auth check at the top of component:
```typescript
// Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
if (!user || !userData) {
  console.log('[Dashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login');
  return <Redirect href="/login" />;
}
```

#### 2. **app/principal/dashboard.tsx** - Principal Dashboard
- Added `Redirect` import from 'expo-router'
- Added two auth checks:
  1. Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
  2. Redirect to main dashboard if user role is not 'principal'
```typescript
// Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
if (!user || !userData) {
  console.log('[PrincipalDashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login');
  return <Redirect href="/login" />;
}

// Redirect to dashboard if user is not principal
if (userData.role !== 'principal') {
  console.log('[PrincipalDashboard] User is not a principal, redirecting to dashboard');
  return <Redirect href="/(tabs)/dashboard" />;
}
```

#### 3. **app/teacher/dashboard.tsx** - Teacher Dashboard
- Added `Redirect` import from 'expo-router'
- Added two auth checks:
  1. Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
  2. Redirect to main dashboard if user role is not 'teacher'
```typescript
// Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
if (!user || !userData) {
  console.log('[TeacherDashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login');
  return <Redirect href="/login" />;
}

// Redirect to main dashboard if user is not a teacher
if (userData.role !== 'teacher') {
  console.log('[TeacherDashboard] User is not a teacher, redirecting to dashboard');
  return <Redirect href="/(tabs)/dashboard" />;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Complete Logout Flow:
1. User clicks logout → Confirmation dialog appears
2. User confirms → SettingsMenu calls `signOut()`
3. `signOut()` clears Firebase session and auth state
4. AuthContext clears `user` and `userData` state
5. Dashboard components re-render with null user/userData
6. **Auth guards detect this** → Component returns `<Redirect href="/login" />`
7. Router redirects to `/login` page
8. User is now on the login screen ✅

### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Impossible to stay on protected pages after logout
- ✅ Role-based verification (teacher/principal pages verify role)
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized access to role-specific dashboards
- ✅ Automatic redirect on any authentication state change

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Log in as principal
- [ ] Click logout button
- [ ] Confirm logout dialog
- [ ] Verify redirected to login page
- [ ] Check console logs show redirect reason
- [ ] Repeat for teacher role
- [ ] Repeat for donor/admin roles
- [ ] Test manual browser back button doesn't bypass redirect

## Console Logs Added

When logging out, you should see:
```
[SettingsMenu] Starting sign out...
[AuthContext] Starting signOut...
[AuthContext] Firebase signOut completed
[AuthContext] Clearing local state
[AuthContext] Local state cleared
[SettingsMenu] Sign out completed successfully
[Dashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login
```

Or for principal/teacher:
```
[PrincipalDashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login
[TeacherDashboard] User not authenticated, redirecting to login
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard auth guard
2. `app/principal/dashboard.tsx` - Principal dashboard auth guard
3. `app/teacher/dashboard.tsx` - Teacher dashboard auth guard

## Related Previous Fixes

This completes the logout fix that started with:
- `components/SettingsMenu.tsx` - Added confirmation dialog
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed state clearing logic
- Now: Added redirect logic to complete the flow

## Notes

- All dashboard pages now properly handle logout
- Route-based verification prevents wrong role access
- Logging helps with debugging
- No back-door ways to stay logged in after logout
